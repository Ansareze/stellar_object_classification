The categorization of stars, galaxies, and quasars based on their
spectral properties is a crucial concept in astronomy.
By dividing stars into different categories based on factors such as their
temperature, luminosity, and chemical composition, we can gain insight into their
physical properties and evolutionary stages. Early cataloging efforts of stars and
their positioning in the sky led to the discovery that they were part of our own
galaxy, and as telescopes became moreadvanced, it was determined that other galaxies
existed, such as Andromeda, which sparked further study. This dataset aims to
classify stars, galaxies, and quasars according to their spectral properties.
